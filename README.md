# BlueprintSplinesTrack-master-4.20
Blueprint Spline Based Road Track Generater for Unreal Engine 4.20

You may have seen the livestream bellow where Zak Parrish put this project together in around an hour to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the Spline Mesh Component. Now you can add this asset pack to any project and have roads in a flash! The road generating Blueprint is fully commented, so you can learn from it and adapt it to your needs.

The project has been modified from the original Markeplace sample to update it to 4.20. It's a fork of swallowdrago/BlueprintSplinesTrack-master-4.19
